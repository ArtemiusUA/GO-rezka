# GO-rezka

Simple scrapper and webapp to have a local copy of the HD rezka VOD data and minimalistic webapp 
for convenient usage on Smart TV without advertising adds and other crapware.

My first attempt to learn and use Go for something real.

The main intent was to use it on disk storage with minimal CPU/RAM consuming.
And, from this point of view, it plays better there in comparison with same Python app used previously.    

### Stack

### TODO

- Extend support for all types of the content (for now it scraps only films)
- Add quality switch
- Add subtitles
